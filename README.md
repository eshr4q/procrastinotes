Procrastinotes is a simple and intuitive sticky note application designed to help people manage tasks and deadlines more efficiently. If you're prone to procrastination, this app helps by providing visual cues when your deadlines are approaching.
Features

    Add Sticky Notes: You can create sticky notes with a title, content, and a deadline.
    Drag and Drop: Notes can be freely dragged across the wall, allowing for better spatial organization.
    Deadline Alerts: Sticky notes automatically change color to red when the deadline arrives, giving you a visual prompt to focus on the task.
    Editable on the Fly: You can edit the content or title of a note directly on the sticky note itself.
    Auto-Save: All sticky notes and their positions are saved locally on your browser so they remain available when you refresh or return to the app.
